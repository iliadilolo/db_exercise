# Test Assignment 

### Distributing test execution to multiple worker machines

First, I modified the data entry file to hide the assignment details from thousands of my followers. I kept the PDF format. 
I used PyPDF2 library to create list with needed data.


Then I assigned tasks to required machines and created files... but no more details here!


Thank you for attention.
